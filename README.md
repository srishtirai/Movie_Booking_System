## Movie Booking System
The Movie Ticket Booking System is designed to cater to a diverse set of users which includes
the consumers who want to browse through movies, check ratings book tickets etc. and
administrators and staff who manage the movie listings, theaters, and bookings. The primary
consumers are people who want a convenient platform for exploring available movies and
checking showtimes and ratings. These users can register for an account to access personalized
features like ticket booking, booking history and email notifications.
For consumers, the journey begins with exploring the platform's movie listings. They can browse
through a variety of movies, each accompanied by detailed information. Registered users can
manage their profiles, track past and upcoming bookings, and receive timely notifications. On
the other side, administrators oversee the entire movie management system. They have the
authority to add, update, or remove movie listings, theatres, and showtimes. While staff will have
restricted access, they will not be able to remove movie listings or showtimes, etc.

## Database Configuration

The application is configured to use MySQL as the database.
Update the `application.properties` file with your MySQL database configuration:
`src/main/resources/application.properties`
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/final_project_esd
spring.datasource.username=[Username]
spring.datasource.password=[Password]
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```
 Entities are designed to represent real-world objects, and relationships are modelled to reflect the business logic.
 
 ## Notable Design points
 
1. GUI - We have used **Thymleaf** templates to create interactive pages.
2. Database - **MySQL** has been used to store the data for the application.
3. ORM - **Hibernate** has been used to maintain data persistence.
4. Framework  - **Spring boot** has been used to create a stand-alone application.
5. Security - **Spring Security** has been implemented to ensure session management and role-based authentication & authorization
 
 ## Database Schema

Create a new schema named course_registration_db in MySql and the tables are created automatically based on the JPA entity definitions.
